> A minimal Universal React redux JS stack using [Flow](http://flowtype.org), with hot reloading, linting and serverside renderring.

This is a universal react project. It provides serverside rendering and uses Flow syntax. We put together React Redux Saucepan here at [elsewhen](http://elsewhen.co), and included the things you most likely need and ake out the things you may not want. We also do our best to keep this maintained and updated. Posting any issues, questions, suggestions and PRs are more than welcome :).

![Getting started](/docs/images/install.png)

First make sure you have at least node 8, and we recommend using npm 6

- Clone the repo, 

```shell
git clone  https://github.com/elsewhencode/react-redux-saucepan
```

- Then enter the folder `react-redux-saucepan`

```shell
cd react-redux-saucepan
```

- Install the dependencies

```shell
npm i
```

- Start developing, or...

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

- build and run it in production

```shell
npm start
```


## Commands
![Commands](/docs/images/console.png)

- To build for production and start the server (includes Flow and Lint check in webpack build):

```shell
npm start
```

- To only build in production (it dumps the files in `dist` folder):

```shell
npm run build
```

- To start in develop with hot reloading (includes babel-watch for server-side code changes):

```shell
npm run start:dev
```

- To run a type check and a flow coverage report:

```shell
npm run flow
```

- To check code style (for both stylelint and eslint):

```shell
npm run lint
```

- Runs the tests (if there is any)

```shell
npm test
```

## Developing
![Developing](/docs/images/development.png)

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building for production
![Project Structure](/docs/images/production.png)

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.


## Configuration

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Project guidelines
