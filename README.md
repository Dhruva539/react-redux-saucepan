> A minimal Universal React JS stack using [flow types][flow].

This is a universal react project. It provides serverside rendering and uses Flow syntax. We put together React Redux Saucepan here at [elsewhen](http://elsewhen.co), therefore we do our best to keep this maintained and updated. We also know love to make this better for you and us so all your issues, questions, suggestions and PRs are more than welcome :).

## What's inside

## Installing / Getting started
![Getting started](/docs/images/install.png)

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

```shell
commands here
```

Here you should say what actually happens when you execute the code above.


## Commands

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.
